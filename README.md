# Dotfiles REPO
ðŸš€ The scope of this repos is to unifi all config files for various cli tools and allow the ability to reproduce the same setup on any new Unix-like machine.

ðŸš€ In order to use the dotfiles in this repo, I suggest to use [_gnu stow_](https://github.com/aspiers/stow/) utility in order to automate the config files deployment and maintenance.

---

## Example Usage
- Install _gnu stow_ utility
- Clone the repo
- cd into the repo
- "stow" away the desired config files 

---

Let's assume in the repo you have the config files for *tmux*, *starship* and *kitty*, and we want to deploy *tmux's* config files. In this situation, the command to execute would be: 

`stow -S tmux -t ~/.`
