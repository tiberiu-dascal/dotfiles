# Dotfiles REPO
ðŸš€ The scope of this repos is to unifi all config files for various cli tools and allow the ability to reproduce the same setup on any new Unix-like machine.
ðŸš€ In order to use the dotfiles in this repo, I suggest to use [_gnu stow_](https://github.com/aspiers/stow/) utility in order to automate the config files deployment and maintenance.
